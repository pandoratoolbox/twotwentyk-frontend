              YOU ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET, AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY UNLESS IT IS DUE TO OUR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.

              COLLECTIBLES ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS THAT EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE POLYGON BLOCKCHAIN. ALL SMART CONTRACTS ARE CONDUCTED AND OCCUR ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE POLYGON BLOCKCHAIN. WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER AND MAKE NO GUARANTEES OR PROMISES WITH RESPECT TO SMART CONTRACTS.

              GAMBLING AND FANTASY SPORTS DISCLAIMERS

              IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS MAY CONSIDER THAT CERTAIN OF THE SERVICES CONSTITUTE FANTASY SPORTS OR GAMBLING AND ARE GOVERNED BY APPLICABLE STATE STATUTES AND REGULATIONS.  WHEN PARTICIPANTS TRADE, SELL, STAKE OR POOLTHEIR COLLECTIBLES, THEY ARE UTILIZING SKILL TO CHOOSE THE COLLECTIBLE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS. GAMES OF SKILL ARE PERMITTED IN MOST JURISDICTIONS AND DO NOT CONSTITUTE GAMBLING (WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRES A GAME OF CHANCE, PRIZE, AND CONSIDERATION TO PLAY).  SOME JURISDICTIONS LIMIT GAMES OF SKILL WHERE PAYMENTS ARE INVOLVED.  IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED PERMITS SKILL-BASED COMPETITIONS. WHEN YOU PARTICIPATE IN COMPETITIONS, THESE TERMS SHALL APPLY.

              <h4>  12. ASSUMPTION OF RISK </h4>

              <TermSubUnderlineHeading>(i) Value and Volatility.</TermSubUnderlineHeading> The prices of both collectible and non-collectible blockchain assets are extremely volatile and subjective and collectible blockchain assets have no inherent or intrinsic value. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your Collectibles, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any Collectibles purchased, will retain their original value, as the value of collectibles is inherently subjective and factors occurring outside of the Platform may materially impact the value and desirability of any particular Collectible.<br />

              <TermSubUnderlineHeading>(ii) Tax Calculations.</TermSubUnderlineHeading>  You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Collectible-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions, both on and off the Platform. <br />

              <TermSubUnderlineHeading>(iii) Use of Blockchain.</TermSubUnderlineHeading> The Platform does not store, send, or receive Collectibles. This is because Collectibles exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Polygon blockchain. Any transfer of Collectibles occurs within the Polygon blockchain, and not on the Platform.<br />

              <TermSubUnderlineHeading>(iv) Inherent Risks with Internet Currency.</TermSubUnderlineHeading> There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your electronic wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Polygon blockchain, however caused.<br />

              <TermSubUnderlineHeading>(v) Regulatory Uncertainty.</TermSubUnderlineHeading> The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies and digital assets, is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Platform, your use and access of the Platform, and therefore the potential utility or value of your Collectibles.<br />

              <TermSubUnderlineHeading>(vi) Software Risks.</TermSubUnderlineHeading> Upgrades to the Polygon blockchain, a hard fork in the Polygon blockchain, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Polygon blockchain may have unintended, adverse effects any network on the Polygon blockchain, including the Platform.

              <h4>  15. FORCE MAJEURE </h4>

We will use diligent efforts to end the failure or delay and ensure the effects of such Force Majeure Event are minimized. We will resume the performance of our obligations as soon as reasonably practicable after the removal of the cause. In the event that our failure or delay remains uncured for a period of forty-five (45) consecutive days following written notice given by us under this Section, we may thereafter terminate these Terms upon fifteen (15) days' written notice.

The most recent version of the Rules is available at www.jamsadr.com/rules-download and are hereby incorporated by reference.

              <TermSubUnderlineHeading>(ii) Arbitration Fees.</TermSubUnderlineHeading> You and we agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and we will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.
